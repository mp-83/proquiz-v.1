TEXT_1 = "The Mechanical Turk was a fake chess-playing machine, constructed and unveiled in 1770 "
"by Wolfgang von Kempelen to impress the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The Turk appeared to be "
"able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, as well as perform the knight's tour, "
"a puzzle that requires the player to move a knight to occupy every square of a chessboard exactly "
"once. Until its destruction by fire, it was exhibited by various owners as an automaton, though it "
"was eventually revealed to be an elaborate hoax. Following word of its debut, interest in the "
"machine grew across Europe. Kempelen, however, was more interested in his other projects and avoided "
"exhibiting the Turk, often lying about the machine's repair status to prospective challengers. "
"In the decade following its debut at Schönbrunn Palace, the Turk only played one opponent, Sir "
"Robert Murray Keith, a Scottish noble, and Kempelen went as far as dismantling the Turk entirely "
"following the match. Kempelen was quoted as referring to the invention as a 'mere bagatelle', as "
"he was not pleased with its popularity and would rather continue work on steam engines and machines "
"that replicated human speech. In 1781, Kempelen was ordered by Emperor Joseph II to reconstruct the "
"Turk and deliver it to Vienna for a state visit from Grand Duke Paul of Russia and his wife. The "
"appearance was so successful that Grand Duke Paul suggested a tour of Europe for the Turk, a request "
"to which Kempelen reluctantly agreed. The Turk began its European tour in 1783, beginning with an "
"appearance in France in April. Upon arrival in Paris in May 1783, it was displayed to the public and "
"played a variety of opponents, including a lawyer named Mr. Bernard who was a second rank in chess "
"ability. Following the sessions at Versailles, demands increased for a match with François-André "
"Danican Philidor, who was considered the best chess player of his time. Moving to the Café de la "
"Régence, the machine played many of the most skilled players, often losing, until securing a match "
"with Philidor at the Académie des Sciences. While Philidor won his match with the Turk, Philidor's "
"son noted that his father called it his most fatiguing game of chess ever! The Turk's final game in "
"Paris was against Benjamin Franklin, who was serving as ambassador to France from the United States."
